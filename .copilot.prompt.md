Update `sycript copilot` command:
1. `copilot` command on server may take several minutes to execute, so instead of waiting for the command to finish (bu updating nohup command and adding `&` to proper place to not blocking the current ssh session), the `syncript copilot` command should check the log file periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds) for any updates and stream the output back to the local terminal in real-time. This way, users can see the progress of the copilot command as it runs on the remote server without having to wait for it to complete.
