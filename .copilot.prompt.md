Update `sycript copilot logs` command:
1. open `sycript copilot logs <session-id>` command should retrieve the log file corresponding to the specified session ID and display its contents in a paginated format (e.g., using `less` or `more` command) to allow for easier navigation through large log files.
2. If the log file for the specified session ID does not exist, the command should display an appropriate error message to the user indicating that the log file could not be found.
3. `sycript copilot logs` interactive listing can be cancelled by Esc or Ctrl+C key press, and should handle these interruptions gracefully by exiting the listing mode without displaying an error message.
    *. Content of the selected log file should be displayed in a paginated format (e.g., using `less` or `more` command) to allow for easier navigation through large log files. If the user cancels the pagination (e.g., by pressing `q` in `less`), it should return to the log listing without exiting the entire command.
