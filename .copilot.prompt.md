Update `sycript copilot` command:
1. Never retry the copilot command if it fails, because it may cause unintended consequences on the remote server. Instead, inquiry the log file periodically for any updates and stream the output back to the local terminal in real-time. `copilot` command on server may take several minutes to execute, so we should not retry it if it fails, but rather keep the connection alive and stream the output as it comes in.
