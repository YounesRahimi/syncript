1. Enhance `sycript copilot run --resume latest` and `sycript copilot logs latest` to automatically identify and operate on the most recent copilot session log file, allowing users to easily resume or view the latest session without needing to specify the session ID. This enhancement should include logic to determine the most recent log file based on timestamps and ensure that the correct file is targeted for resuming or viewing logs. Additionally, implement error handling to manage cases where no log files are available or if there are issues accessing the log files.
