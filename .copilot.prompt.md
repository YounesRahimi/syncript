Update `sycript copilot logs` command:

1. Make it interactive to select a log file from the list of available logs in the `~/.syncript/logs/` directory. When the user runs `syncript copilot logs` without a session ID argument, it should display a numbered list of available log files with their corresponding session IDs and timestamps. The user can then input the number corresponding to the log file they want to view, and the contents of that log file will be displayed in the terminal scrolled to the last 50 lines and if user press 'Esc' it should return back to the list of logs. Note: The terminal output should not be polluted with the log file contents even if the user selects a log file to view. The log file contents should be displayed in a clean and organized manner, allowing the user to easily read and navigate through the logs without any distractions from other terminal output.
2. Logs timestamp should be formatted in local timezone and should be human-readable (e.g., `2024-06-01 14:30:00` instead of a Unix timestamp).
