Refactor `sycript copilot` command:
1. Currently `sycript copilot` command executes the copilot CLI tool on the remote server and streams the output back to the local terminal in real-time. Move this functionality to a new command called `sycript copilot run` to better organize the commands and separate the execution logic from the log management and other functionalities related to the copilot command.
